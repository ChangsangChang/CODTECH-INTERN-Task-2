# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## INTRODUCTION
Credit card fraud detection is a critical process aimed at identifying and preventing unauthorized transactions.As digital transactions become more prevalent, the risk of fraud increases, posing significant challenges to financial institutions and consumers. Utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning and real-time data analysis, fraud detection systems strive to accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. This ensures the security of transactions while minimizing false alarms, thereby maintaining trust in the financial ecosystem.

## APPLIED METHODS
- **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**:Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category. The algorithm applies a logistic function to a linear combination of input features, producing a value between 0 and 1, which is then thresholded to assign a class label. It's widely used due to its simplicity and interpretability.
-  **RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER**:A Random Forest classifier is an ensemble learning method used for classification tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (the majority vote) across the individual trees.
- **NAIVE BAYES**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features. Despite this "naive" assumption, it often performs well in practice, especially for text classification tasks like spam detection. It calculates the posterior probability of each class given the input features and assigns the class with the highest probability. It is fast, simple, and effective for large datasets.

## EVALUATION
The model is evaluated using accuracy score,precision score,f1 scorea and recall score.
